### Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI mode

TCP/IP model is similar to the OSI model. It has different layers like the OSI model. One of the differences between TCP/IP model and OSI model is that TCP/IP model has four (4) layers while OSI model has seven (7) layers. Unlike the OSI model that has Application, Presentation and Session layers, TCP/IP model has the three layers (Application, Presentation & Session) summed up in one known as Application layer

**TCP/IP model consists of the following layers**

* Application layer: This layer performs the functions of top three layers of the OSI model: Application, Presentation and Session Layer. It is responsible for node-to-node communication and controls user-interface specifications. Some of the protocols present in this layer are: HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP etc. 
* Transport layer: This layer is responsible for end-to-end communication and error-free delivery of data. It shields the upper-layer applications from the complexities of data. The two main protocols present in this layer are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
* Internet layer: This layer is similar to OSI model's Network layer. It defines the protocols which are       responsible for logical transmission of data over the entire network. The main protcols in this layer are IP and ARP.   
* Network Access layer: This layer is a combination of Data Link Layer and Physical Layer of the OSI model. It looks out for hardware addressing and the protocols present in this layer allows for the physical transmission of data.
